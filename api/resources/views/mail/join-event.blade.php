    <p>Important</p>
    <p>You won’t be able to view today’s event or the participant list until you’ve been checked in. Once we officially begin, you’ll be able to make your selections for each person (date, friend, or none) and leave private notes to help jog your memory when your results are sent out tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Please arrive 15 to 30 minutes early to check in, get settled, and be ready to meet some great people. The host will begin right at the scheduled time, and we may not be able to accommodate late arrivals.</p>

    <p>
        We can’t wait to see you!
        <br>
        With love,
    </p>
