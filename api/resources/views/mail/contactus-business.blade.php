    Hello!
    <br><br>
    Excited to hear you're interested in hosting with us!
    <br><br>
    Here's a quick rundown of how our speed dating events work and what to expect:
    <br><br>
    <div>
        <strong>About Our Events:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>We typically host 20-30 people per event</li>
            <li>Events run about two hours (usually 7-9pm, but we're flexible!)</li>
            <li>Our host handles all check-ins and event management</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <strong>How It Works:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Guests arrive and typically grab a drink during initial mingling</li>
            <li>Our host assigns starting seats and kicks off with a fun icebreaker</li>
            <li>Participants rotate through one-on-one conversations, marking potential matches on their pho</li>
            <li>We include a short break halfway through (perfect for another drink or snack!)</li>
            <li>Match results are delivered to participants the next morning</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <strong>Benefits for Your Venue:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero cost to you because we handle all the planning and promotion</li>
            <li>Bring in new customers who might not have visited otherwise</li>
            <li>Offer your regulars something fun and different</li>
            <li>Beyond just the sales that night, it's about creating memorable experiences at your venue</li>
            <li>We promote your venue through our social media, paid ads, and email outreach</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <strong>Quick Questions to See If We're a Good Fit:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you have a private event room?</li>
            <li>What's your max capacity?</li>
            <li>Do you have small tables for two, or mostly long tables?</li>
            <li>What's the average age range for your typical crowd?</li>
            <li>Which days/times are usually slowest for you where this event would work best?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Let me know if you have any questions!
